The Witch Doctor
Once upon a time there was a village that lived peacefully on a hill until a plague struck. The denizens of the village came to the doctor to attempt to cure their illness, but to no avail. Slowly but surely the denizens began to turn into beings filled with nothing but anger and pain, and turned their anger towards the doctor. He did not go down without a fight, but then again, he is here, and without an arm.
